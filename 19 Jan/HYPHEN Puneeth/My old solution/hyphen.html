<!-- #1 screening test below ... please submit your result code to all the people in cc.

Your mission, if you choose to accept is to build a UI, where the user can enter text. However, whenever the user types ":)" or "<3", your code should replace the text with a relevant emoji similar to how an instant messenger works.

You can use the attached code as a starting point for your test and submit your solution as a zip folder via email.

Your code has to work only on the latest stable version of Chrome browser.

Also, please take care of the following conditions ...

1. Replace ":)" and "<3" with the respective images similar to how an instant messenger or a chat app works.
2. Once the text has been replaced with the image the text caret should be reset to the right of the image, so that the user can continue typing. -->
